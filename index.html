            <p>Earthlings Learning aims to provide affordable, fun and inspiring tuition 
                in environmental management, sustainability and earth sciences to students 
                of all ages. We aim to foster knowledge and enthusiasm about how the world 
                works either to prepare for future careers or to simply expand your knowledge.</p>

                <p>We currently offer IGCSEs in Environmental Management, Geography and Marine 
                Science. We also offer A-level tuition in Environmental Science</p>

                <p>We especially work with people for whom traditional schooling isnâ€™t the right fit, 
                    for personal, educational or geographical reasons. We focus on exam 
                    preparation for children and young adults to allow students outside of 
                    traditional education to attain recognised qualifications and access higher 
                    levels of learning. </p>

                <p>In a time of unprecedented environmental challenges, we believe that 
                    increasing understanding of how Earth systems work, how humans influence 
                    them and how to improve this is of paramount importance in our daily lives 
                    and workplaces in all sectors.  </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Environmental Management.</strong>
                            This course is a good all-rounder coverting a wide range of topics in moderate detail. Assessment is fairly straightforward with limited maths and essay writing requirements. Suitable for people beginner their IGCSE journey or to complement other studies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Geography.</strong>
                            The Edexcel syllabus we study is a more specialised and granular study of the environment, focusses on a narrower range of topics than EM but in much higher technical detail. Learning to understand and use graphs, figures and other measurements is important as is using these to longer essay-style answers. Possible to start with but functions very well after/during EM increasing understanding of human systems and communities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Marine Science.</strong>
                            This course looks at issues seen in EM with a much more scientific approach. Benefits from existing knowledge from other sciences like biology and chemistry. Some experimental work is involved which is an important part of the assessment but this can be done fairly easily when demonstrated in class. Not recommended as a starting IGCSE but certainly works well with EM. Looks at different skills and topic areas to geography with fairly limited overlap.</li>
                            
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong><a href="/pages/environmentalScience.html" target="_blank" style="color: inherit">Environmental Science.</a></strong>
                            This is a bit like IGCSE Environmental Management but with the maths and the science dialled up significantly. It looks at the same topics as environmental management but in much greater technical detail, testing some maths and some manipulation of evidence as well. A grasp of maths at least at GCSE is advised and is supported well by any other sciences at GCSE level. Would consider EM a prerequisite for this one. Fieldwork with an accredited provider is essential to sit the exam.</li>
