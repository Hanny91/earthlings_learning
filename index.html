                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Environmental Management.</strong>
                            This course is a good all-rounder coverting a wide range of topics in moderate detail. Assessment is fairly straightforward with limited maths and essay writing requirements. Suitable for people beginner their IGCSE journey or to complement other studies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Geography.</strong>
                            The Edexcel syllabus we study is a more specialised and granular study of the environment, focusses on a narrower range of topics than EM but in much higher technical detail. Learning to understand and use graphs, figures and other measurements is important as is using these to longer essay-style answers. Possible to start with but functions very well after/during EM increasing understanding of human systems and communities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Marine Science.</strong>
                            This course looks at issues seen in EM with a much more scientific approach. Benefits from existing knowledge from other sciences like biology and chemistry. Some experimental work is involved which is an important part of the assessment but this can be done fairly easily when demonstrated in class. Not recommended as a starting IGCSE but certainly works well with EM. Looks at different skills and topic areas to geography with fairly limited overlap.</li>

                            <li><strong><a href="/pages/environmentalScience.html">Environmental Science.</a></strong>
                            This is a bit like IGCSE Environmental Management but with the maths and the science dialled up significiantly. It looks at the same topics as environmental management but in much greater technical detail, testing some maths and some manipulation of evidence as well. A grasp of maths at least at GCSE is advised and is supported well by any other sciences at GCSE level. Would consider EM a prerequisite for this one. Fieldwork with an accredited provider is essential to sit the exam.</li>
