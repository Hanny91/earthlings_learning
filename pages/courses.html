        <ul>
            <li>All courses are online using Zoom. Lessons are all recorded and stored securely online in case the students miss a class or want to watch them again .</li>
            <li>Courses are designed around UK iGCSEs. We do three things really: learn the material on the syllabus, practice to pass the exams, and most importantly learn as many interesting and weird facts about the subject as we can!</li>
            <li>The classes are generally based around a presentation and as much discussion and as many random tangents as the students feel like. We try to deal with even complicated topics in a relaxed way.</li>
            <li>Discussion is encouraged, as is having your camera and microphone on but students are welcome to engage however they like. There's no pressure to speak up so students can take back seat whenever they feel like it.</li>
            <li>Homework is generally given every other week and fulfills a lot of the assessment to check students' progress</li>
        </ul>

                            <p>Environmental Management (EM) is the study of environmental processes and systems and how to manage the influences of human activity on these systems. 
                                We consider the benefits humans get from ‘nature’, the impacts of humans on their environmentandhowto manage these impacts more sustainably.</p>
                            <p>This syllabus covers a broad range of interesting topics from the natural world that are accessible and relevent to students
                                and is therefore ideal for those starting their secondary-level education, those with an interest in the natural world or the sciences, 
                                or those wishing to complement other studies with a better understandingof global systems</p>

                                This course teaches the new 2027-29 syllabus effective for examinations from Summer 2027 onwards. Course includes fortnightly homework, exam skills and mock examinations. Also includes some work with graphs, simple maths and basic ecological fieldwork.

                            <p>Environmental Management (EM) is the study of environmental processes and systems and how to manage the influences of human activity on these systems. 
                                We consider the benefits humans get from ‘nature’, the impacts of humans on their environmentandhowto manage these impacts more sustainably.</p>
                            <p>This syllabus covers a broad range of interesting topics from the natural world that are accessible and relevent to students
                                and is therefore ideal for those starting their secondary-level education, those with an interest in the natural world or the sciences, 
                                or those wishing to complement other studies with a better understandingof global systems</p>

                            <p>The ES syllabus builds on existing studies in disciplines such as Environmental Management, Geography or Marine Science. 
                                Some prior experience in these disciplines and some basic mathematics is expected. This course provides all of the content
                                and assessment necessary to take the exam but as an A-level self-study is an increasingly important part of studied.
                                Classes will deliver content, concept-check understanding and most importantly provide a forum for students to collaborate
                                and share their knowledge. There are some practical requirements to this course and a mandatory fieldtrip with a registered
                                provider is a requirement of many independent exam centres for sitting the exam, and a joint fieldtrip will be organised 
                                in collaboration with parents and students during the course</p>
