                        <div class="full-content hidden">
                            <p>Tutors & Exams provides examination and assessment facilities primarily aimed at private and home educated candidates. The company was established in 2014 by a former Examinations Officer and Awarding Organisation Manager with over 25 years' experience in education administration. In the intervening years Tutors & Exams has evolved into a much valued and respected examination venue.</p>
                            <p>Tutors & Exams has nationwide coverage with centres located around the country. All are approved for examination delivery by the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ).</p>
                            <p>In addition to our examination centres, we also have a dedicated Science laboratory based in Birmingham, England with the ability to deliver A Level Science practicals all year round (consecutive four-day course for each subject). We have also partnered with two schools in London to deliver Science practicals outside of term time, using their labs.</p>
                            <p>In 2020/21 Tutors & Exams delivered examination assessments to thousands of candidates. We cater for 95% of all GCSE/GCE, International GCSE/GCE and Pearson Edexcel International A Level subjects alongside Functional Skills. We are also willing to consider requests for additional subjects that we do not currently cater for.</p>
                            <p>To ensure access to assessment is available to ALL learners we have our own SENCo who can assist in organising access arrangements if required.</p>
                            <p>We work in partnership with many large, respected distance learning providers and online schools, and very much value these relationships to deliver high quality assessment for their learners. We also accommodate private training organisations delivering qualifications to sizeable cohorts spread geographically throughout the UK. Furthermore, we also facilitate examinations for a growing number of universities to deliver their distance learning programmes. The University of London, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh Napier University, Loughborough University and Edinburgh Business School are already valued clients. Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing and AAT (Association of Accountancy Technicians) assessments are also available in our centres.</p>
                            <p>When taking a course with Earthlings Learning you can get their Partner Rate which can mean up to a 15% discount on exams at these centres.</p>
